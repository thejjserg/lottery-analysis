# Lottery Analysis

Powerball is an American lottery game where a player selects five numbers between 1 and 69. These five numbers are the five white balls. In addition, a player selects one number between 1 and 26. This number is the red Powerball, which acts as a multiplier.

Players can choose their numbers on a play slip or let the lottery terminal randomly pick their numbers.

## Project Overview
This project was derived when I was thinking the following questions
- Allowing the lottery terminal to pick my numbers feels... boring? rigged? Is there a way to pick numbers myself to give myself a statistical advantage?
- If the odds of winning the Powerball Lottery are 1 in 292,201,338 for any combination of numbers, then why don't I pick 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6? But that doesn't feel right... but why?
- Which numbers should I choose and why?

These questions are the basis of the study below, and although we may not fully answer them, they will serve as the driving force for the discussion and overall strategies noted in the conclusion of the analysis.
