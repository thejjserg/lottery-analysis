    "\n",
    "With an α = 0.05, we **fail to reject the null hypotheses** for both of the Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Tests since there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the observed frequency distribution deviates from what is expected under a uniform distribution assumption.\n",

    "This shows that the numbers drawn in the Powerball is consistent to randomness. The game may be fair and may not be influenced by any systematic biases or irregularities. Although the observed frequencies do not perfectly match a uniform distribution, the differences may be minor and are thus statistically insignificant. These observed differences could be due to random fluctuations.\n",

    "However, failing to reject the null hypothesis does not prove that the lottery game is fair or that there are no biases. We will continue to investigate throughout the study."
